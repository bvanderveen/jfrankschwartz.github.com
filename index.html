                        <p>My name is Frank, and after a long path I have arrived at bodywork as my profession.</p>

                        <p>I enrolled at East-West College of the Healing Arts (www.eastwestcollege.com) in January of 2009 and graduated from their 1002 Hour program (the most in-depth training they offer) in June of 2010 with a 3.87 GPA.</p>

                        <p>Under their auspices I studied modalities Cranio-Sacral &amp; Myofascial, Deep Tissue, Swedish, Thai, Trigger Point and Tui-Na.  My instructors included Cyr Foote, Jon Hart, James Spake, Allie Longstreth-Lurie, Alex Susbauer and Uma Tupper, all accomplished therapists in their respective disciplines.</p>

                        <p>I am furthering my education in Thai massage under Allie Longstretch-Lurie this year with a Level II class, and am planning to travel to Thailand in 2011 with her for advanced Northern-style training.</p> 

                        <p>My approach to bodywork is holistic, regarding the body-mind as a whole unit and addressing each person where they are at that day. I have referrals for practitioners in other disciplines as well.</p>

                    <div id="content-massage" style="display:none">
                        <p>My types of massage usually fall into one of four categories:</p>

                        Relaxation <br>
                        Structural Therapy <br>
                        Cranio-Sacral <br>
                        Thai <br>

                        <p>Relaxation is typically Swedish-based and is just as enjoyable and therapeutic mentally as it is physically.  I provide a safe space for you to take a time out from life and indulge!  </p>

                        <p>Structural Therapy is a more active physical and functional-based approach.  It involves more overall movement, sometimes deeper work, and more communication.  I always start this with a standing and moving assessment to determine imbalances related to soft tissue.  For this type of massage I request my clients stay minimally clothed for the assessment and massage so that I can do more active work without having to spend time on elaborate draping.  I combine elements from many of the modalities I have studied (see ABOUT section) to affect changes.  This massage is not the most relaxing, but can help reverse limiting conditions in your body!  Those who sit for long periods or perform lots of repetitive motions (such as athletes) can often benefit from this. </p> 

                        <p>Cranio-Sacral works from the inside out by releasing restrictions in the movement of the cranio-sacral fluid and accompanying cranial bone movements.  This is very subtle but deeply relaxing and can have profound effects.  </p>

                        <p>Thai is sometimes described as "passive yoga".  It is done on a cushion or mat on the floor, and involves a series of stretching positions and lots of compression.  It is difficult to adequately describe, but I would recommend searching for videos of it to get a better idea.  This is my favorite type of massage to perform and is wonderful for invigoration, increasing your flow of chi and increasing flexibility! </p>

                        <p>Rates are $60/60 minutes and $90/90 minutes.  

                        <p>If you are interested in a time increment other than that, feel free to ask and we can discuss it.  </p>

                        <p>Gift certificates are available with advance request.  </p>

                        <p>Currently I am unable to offer insurance billing, and can only accept cash or cheques. </p> 

                        <p>If you are a service industry worker (barkeep/barista/dancer/kitchen staff/wait staff et c.), ask for a discount!  </p>

                        <p>Barters for goods or services will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  </p>

                        <p>Cancellations of less than 24 hours before the scheduled appointment are subject to half the price of the scheduled massage.  Any exceptions are determined by me.</p>  

                        <p>I reserve the right to refuse service to anyone at any time and for any reason.  </p>

                        <p>No sexual services are offered or implied.</p>
