                    <p>My name is Frank, and after a long path I have arrived at bodywork as my profession.</p>

                    <p>I enrolled at East-West College of the Healing Arts (www.eastwestcollege.com) in January of 2009 and graduated from their 1002 Hour program (the most in-depth training they offer) in June of 2010 with a 3.87 GPA.</p>

                    <p>Under their auspices I studied modalities Cranio-Sacral &amp; Myofascial, Deep Tissue, Swedish, Thai, Trigger Point and Tui-Na.  My instructors included Cyr Foote, Jon Hart, James Spake, Allie Longstreth-Lurie, Alex Susbauer and Uma Tupper, all accomplished therapists in their respective disciplines.</p>

                    <p>I am furthering my education in Thai massage under Allie Longstretch-Lurie this year with a Level II class, and am planning to travel to Thailand in 2011 with her for advanced Northern-style training.</p> 

                    <p>My approach to bodywork is holistic, regarding the body-mind as a whole unit and addressing each person where they are at that day. I have referrals for practitioners in other disciplines as well.</p>
